JavaScript Assignment 2

This assignment required that a Trivia Game be created.  

The game contained in this repository has 20 questions, which span across sports, popular culture, history, and more.  

The player will get 30 seconds per question, at the end of the game the score is tallied and presented to the player, with the option to restart the game.

The Trivia Game was our first project using Intervals in Javascript. It made for a very interesting project. This project didn't take a terribly long time to code the HTML and CSS, especially after having figured out how I wanted the site to look. One of the more difficult aspects was keeping track of the remaining time, and which answer the user selected based on the button, and then relating that to the questions in the Javascript object. I spent more time than I care to admit trying to come up with questions for the game.
